If there is a program you are trying to mod and can't read the names of assets because they are in a foreign language, this app will automatically rename all files so that their names can be easily read.

-------------------

How to use:

Place translator.py in the directory of the files you wish to be translated and their name will be automatically translated into English when the app runs.

There is no way to undo this after it is done, so be careful and make sure to backup your files.

This app requires deep-translator to be installed in your Python library. (run "pip3 install deep-translator" in cmd)
